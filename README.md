# Wordle Clone in React

This is a sample clone of the popular word-guessing game **Wordle** built using **React**. The game includes core features such as validating guesses, providing feedback (color-coded hints), and tracking the game state. The game is designed to help you practice React development by building a small and interactive application.

## Features 

  **Guess a 5-letter word**: Users can make guesses to try and match the target word.
  **Feedback mechanism**: Correct letters in the right position are shown in **green**, correct letters in the wrong position are shown in **yellow**, and incorrect letters are shown in **gray**.
  **Game state management**: keeps track of guesses, the number of remaining attempts and the correct game status(win or loss).
  **New game functionality**: allows users to reset the game and start a new round.

## Technologies Used
  **React**: For building the user interface.
  **CSS**: For styling the game.
  **npm**: For package management.
